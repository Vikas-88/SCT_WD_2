# SCT_WD_2
# Advanced Scientific Calculator

A fully functional, interactive **scientific calculator web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project is designed to strengthen core frontend skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, input parsing, and UI state management.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This calculator goes beyond basic arithmetic operations by supporting scientific calculations, keyboard input, calculation history tracking, and modern UI design principles. The application is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript to emphasize fundamental frontend concepts without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

The interface features a **glassmorphism-based design** and a **dark/light theme toggle**, providing a clean and modern user experience.
